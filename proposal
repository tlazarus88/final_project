My pitch is to design a companion website for Brokelyn’s Middle Brooklyn Beer Book found here.

The beer book is a coupon book that grants you one free beer at over 30 different bars in the middle Brooklyn region. My website would help current and potential purchasers of the beer book sort through each venue and determine which bar would be best for their current needs. 

The homepage would be an animated questionnaire that would ask forking questions like “how many people are you going out with, are you looking for food as well, etc.” that would slowly whittle away to what bar would best match with the user’s needs. 

When a match is found, each venue will have a designed page that will display: a brief description of the bar, a map of its location, pertinent contact information, a photo, as well as populated reviews from Yelp about the venue. 

The website will feature two other filter functions in its navigation bar: a map view and a tiled list.
Each view will support sorting filters that help refine the criteria the user is searching for.
